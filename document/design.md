## Design

* Here we want to have a plugin

when you execute an sample

```
before you excute an action.
---
run plugin
---
show the graphic interface either activity or fragment
---

```

The graph above is more like the OOP programming

Another necessary demand was when I want to change the graphic interface.
* First one: I want to inject the message panel to user graphic interface.
* Second one:Plus document panel in the right side, and source code?
* The others: Memory analysis panel?

What do we want?
* We maybe change the view. that activity and fragment already has.
* In that case, Either Activity or Fragment could get the view.

This will combine the plugin above.



#### About Component:
Question:
* We have Activity or fragment maybe dialog???

* The only change we have for a activity was when I remove view from window
For a fragment?
For a Dialog?


We need a window delegate???
